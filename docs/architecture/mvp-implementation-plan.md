# MVP Implementation Plan (Working Baseline)

## Delivered now
- Runnable catalog + lesson pages (`public/index.php`)
- Search + filters (module and layer)
- Typed lesson model with metadata fields for architecture layers
- Lesson repository with query/filter APIs
- Basic markdown-to-HTML rendering for snippets/content blocks
- Seeded lessons for Modules 1–3

## Why this step matters
This moves the project from a static blueprint to a working product slice where users can navigate and consume task-driven lessons.

## Next slices
1. Add progress tracking and completed-lesson state.
2. Add lesson relation graph (prerequisites/recommended next).
3. Add search index prebuild for faster lookup on large lesson sets.
4. Add module dashboard views and lesson status analytics.
